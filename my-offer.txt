Hi. I am a Software engineer with 6 years of experience.
I am looking for a job right now. I know there are a lot of job sites online. Upwork(upwork.com) is one of them.
I'd like to work on this site. But I need Europe or America account because it is so easy to take job with these account.
So what I am talking to you is that we can make money together if you help me to get this account.
This website track IP address, so I have to work on only your laptop remotely. But don't worry about your personal data in your laptop.
I will only use google browser.
If you help me I will share 12% to 14% of my earning every month. I can earn 3k to 4k per month.
So If you are interested in my suggestion, please ping me.

I am neither a scammer nor a hacker.
Hope to hear from you soon.
But If you are not interesting don't send message. Thank youuuu
